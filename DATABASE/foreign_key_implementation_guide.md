# Foreign Key Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you implement a foreign key relationship between admin users and uploaded modules, allowing you to track which specific admin uploaded each module.

## Step 1: Run the Database Script
Execute the `add_admin_foreign_key.sql` script in phpMyAdmin:

1. Open phpMyAdmin (`http://localhost/phpmyadmin`)
2. Select your `classxic` database
3. Click the "SQL" tab
4. Copy and paste the entire content of `DATABASE/add_admin_foreign_key.sql`
5. Click "Go" to execute

## Step 2: What the Script Does

### Database Changes:
- ✅ **Adds `uploaded_by_id` column** to `learning_materials` table
- ✅ **Creates foreign key constraint** linking to `users` table
- ✅ **Updates existing records** to reference admin users
- ✅ **Adds performance index** for better query speed

### New Table Structure:
```sql
learning_materials:
- material_id (Primary Key)
- title
- description
- file_url
- uploaded_by_id (Foreign Key → users.user_id)
- upload_date
- is_approved
```

## Step 3: Code Updates (Already Done)

### Files Updated:
- ✅ **`upload_material.php`** - Now uses `$_SESSION['user_id']` for uploads
- ✅ **`admin_modules.php`** - Shows actual admin names instead of "Admin"
- ✅ **`studentmodule.php`** - Shows actual admin names instead of "Admin"

## Step 4: Benefits

### Data Integrity:
- ✅ **Referential integrity** - Can't upload modules with invalid user IDs
- ✅ **Cascade deletion** - If admin is deleted, their modules are also deleted
- ✅ **Data consistency** - All modules have valid admin references

### Better Tracking:
- ✅ **Know exactly which admin** uploaded each module
- ✅ **Display admin names** instead of generic "Admin"
- ✅ **Audit trail** for module uploads

### Performance:
- ✅ **Faster queries** with proper indexing
- ✅ **Efficient joins** between users and modules

## Step 5: Testing

After implementation, test:
1. **Upload a new module** - Should work with current admin user
2. **View modules** - Should show actual admin names
3. **Database integrity** - Foreign key constraints should work
4. **Performance** - Queries should be faster

## Step 6: Troubleshooting

### If you get foreign key errors:
- Make sure you have at least one admin user in the database
- Check that the `uploaded_by_id` column was created successfully
- Verify the foreign key constraint was added

### If you get SQL errors:
- Make sure the database cleanup was completed first
- Check that all files were updated correctly
- Verify session management is working

## Result

After implementation, you'll have:
- ✅ **Proper database relationships**
- ✅ **Better data tracking**
- ✅ **Improved data integrity**
- ✅ **Real admin names displayed**
- ✅ **Professional database structure**
